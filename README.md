## How It Works

The tool uses Selenium with network interception capabilities to:
1. Open the target website in a real Chromium browser
2. Monitor all network traffic (images, scripts, API calls, etc.)
3. Identify and extract API endpoints (looking for JSON responses)
4. Save all the captured data in organized formats

## üöÄ Quick Start (Windows Users)

### Download the .exe (No Installation!)

1. **Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Jayden819432/web-scraper-pro/releases)**
2. **Download `WebScraperPro.exe`** (GUI version - recommended!)
3. **Double-click to run** - That's it!

> **Note:** Windows may show a security warning. Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"

### Using the GUI

1. **Enter a URL** (e.g., `https://httpbin.org/`)
2. **Choose headless mode** (optional, for faster scraping)
3. **Click "Start Scraping"**
4. **View results** in the `scrape_results` folder!

### Using the Command Line

Download `WebScraperCLI.exe` instead:

```bash
WebScraperCLI.exe https://example.com
WebScraperCLI.exe https://example.com --headless
```

## üêç For Developers (Python)

### From Source Code:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run GUI version
python scraper_gui.py

# Run CLI version
python scraper.py https://example.com

# Run interactive menu
python run.py
```

## Output Files

After scraping, you'll find these files in the `scrape_results` folder:

1. **`[domain]_[timestamp]_apis.txt`** - List of all discovered API endpoints with responses
2. **`[domain]_[timestamp].json`** - Complete data: all requests, responses, and metadata
3. **`[domain]_[timestamp].html`** - The full HTML content of the page

## What Gets Captured

- ‚úÖ All HTTP/HTTPS requests
- ‚úÖ API endpoints (especially JSON responses)
- ‚úÖ Request/response headers
- ‚úÖ Response bodies for APIs
- ‚úÖ Page HTML content
- ‚úÖ All domains contacted by the website

## Example Use Cases

- Discover hidden APIs used by websites
- Analyze what data a website requests
- Reverse-engineer web applications
- Research web traffic patterns
- Find API documentation
- Monitor website behavior

## Important Notes

- Only scrape websites you have permission to access
- Respect robots.txt and terms of service
- Be mindful of rate limiting
- This tool is for educational and research purposes

## Technical Details
